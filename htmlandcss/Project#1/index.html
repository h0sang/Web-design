    <h1 id="header">How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>

    <p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1 enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

    <p>What you need to know is that <strong>"Time Is Money"</strong>.
    And this applies even more to the <b>online world</b>, than in regular business.</p>

    <p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur.
    It doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to start.
    A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

    <p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has become all the more critical.
    Your challenge for success is simply to get more done - in <i>less time</i>.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can you do to avoid them?</em></p>

    <ol start="0">
      <li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
      <li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
      <li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
      <li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h2>

    <p>This sounds simple.</p>
    <p>But stop and think how many times you retype the same old simple information.</p>

    <p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to communicating words quickly.</p>

    <p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender.</p>
    <p>This will enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever having to type the same thing twice.</p>

    <p>I use this utility <a href="http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target="_blank" title="Programm type pilot">http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot</a>, but there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities available.</p>

    <h2>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h2>

    <p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your own installed on your computer.</p>

    <p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software set up.</p>
    <p>Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the emails that you don't want.</p>
    <p>Make sure they are filtered into a junk email file, so you can manually sift through them afterwards and pull back any that have been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

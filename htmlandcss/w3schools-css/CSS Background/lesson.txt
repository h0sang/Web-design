	CSS Backgrounds
The CSS background properties are used to define the background effects for elements.
CSS background properties: 
	# background-color;
	# background-image;
	# background-repeat;
	# background-attachment;
	# background-position;

	Background Color
The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.
With CSS, a color is most often specified by:
	# a valid color name - like "red";
	# a HEX value - like "#ff0000";
	# an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)";

	Background Image
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.
By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
The background image for a page can be set like this:
	background-image: url("picture.jpg");
NOTE: When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.

	Background Image - Repeat Horizontelly or Vertically
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.
If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;);
TIP: To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;

	Background Image - Set position and no-repeat
In the example above, the background image is shown in the same place as the text. We want to change 
the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.
The position of the image is specified by the background-position property;

	Background Image - Fixed position
To specify that the background image should be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page), use
the background-attachment property: fixed;

	Background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single
property. This is called a shorthand property.

	Example:
	background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;

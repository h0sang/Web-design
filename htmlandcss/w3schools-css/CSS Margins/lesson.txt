	CSS Margins 	
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around element, outside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin 
for each of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

	Margin - Idividual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:
	# margin-top;
	# margin-right;
	# margin-bottom;
	# margin-left;
All the margin properties can have the following values:
	# auto - the browser calculates the margin
	# lenght - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
	# % - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
	# inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
TIP: Negative value are allowed.

	Margin - Shorthand Property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.
The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:
    # margin-top
    # margin-right
    # margin-bottom
    # margin-left
So, here is how it works:
If the margin property has four values:
    |margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;|
        # top margin is 25px
        # right margin is 50px
        # bottom margin is 75px
        # left margin is 100px

If the margin property has three values:
    margin: 25px 50px 75px;
        # top margin is 25px
        # right and left margins are 50px
        # bottom margin is 75px

If the margin property has two values:
    margin: 25px 50px;
        # top and bottom margins are 25px
        # right and left margins are 50px

If the margin property has one value:
    margin: 25px;
        # all four margins are 25px

	The auto Value
You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.


	The inherit Value
This example lets the left margin of the <p class="ex1"> element be inherited from the parent element (<div>)

	Margin Collapse
Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest 
of the two margins.
This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!
###Example
h1 {
    margin: 0 0 50px 0;
}
h2 {
    margin: 20px 0 0 0;
} 
In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin 
set to 20px.
Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be 
a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.

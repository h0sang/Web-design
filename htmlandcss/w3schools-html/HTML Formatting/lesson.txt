	HTML Formatting Elements 
In the previous chapter, you learned about the HTML style attribute.
HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning.
HTML used elements like <b> and <i> for formatting output, like bold or italic text.
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
	# <b> - Bold text
	# <strong> - Important text
	# <i> - Italic text
	# <em> - Emphasized text
	# <mark> - Marked text
	# <small> - Small text
	# <del> - Deleted text
	# <ins> - Inserted text
	# <sub> - Subscript text
	# <sup> - Superscript text

	HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.
The HTML <strong> element defines strong text, with added semantic "strong" importance.

	HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines italic text, without any extra importance.
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text, with added semantic importance.

NOTE: Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>. However, there is a difference in the meaning of these tags: 
<b> and <i> defines bold and italic text, but <strong> and <em> means that the text is "important".

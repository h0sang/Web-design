	HTML Block and Inline Elements 
Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. 
The default display value for most element is block or inline.

	Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
	The <div> element is a block-level element.
For example
<div>Hello</div>
<div>World</div>

	Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much with as necessary.
This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

	The <div> Element 
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content.

	The <span> Element 
The <span> element is often used as a container for some text.
The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text.

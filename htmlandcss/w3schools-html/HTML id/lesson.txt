	HTML The id Attribute
	Using The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).
The id value can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for a unique element with the specified id value.
In CSS, to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element
TIP: The id attribute can be used on any HTML element.
NOTE: The id value is case-sensitive.

	Difference Between Class and ID
An HTML element can only have one unique id that belongs to that single element, while a class name can be used by multiple
elements;
	
	Using The id Attribute in JavaScript 
JavaScript can access an element with a specified id by using the getElementById() method;

	Bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.
Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.
To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

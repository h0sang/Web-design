	HTML Head
	The HTML <head> Element
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.
The following tags describe metadata: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.
	
	The HTML <title> Element
The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents.
The <title> element:
	# defines a title in the browser tab
	# provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
	# displays a title for the page in search engine results

	The HTML <style> Element
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page;

	The HTML <link> Element
The <link> element is used to link to external style sheets:
	 <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"> 

	The HTML <meta> Element
The <meta> element is used to specify which character set is used, page description, keywords, author, and other metadata.
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
Define the character set used:
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
Refresh document every 30 seconds:
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

	Setting The Viewport
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile 
phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport <meta> tag;
TIP: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference.

	The HTML <script> Element
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.

	Omitting <html>, <head> and <body>?
According to the HTML5 standard; the <html>, the <body>, and the <head> tag can be omitted.

NOTE:
W3Schools does not recommend omitting the <html> and <body> tags. Omitting these tags can 
crash DOM or XML software and produce errors in older browsers (IE9).
However, omitting the <head> tag has been a common practice for quite some time now.

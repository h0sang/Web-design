	HTML Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

#All HTML elements can have attributess
#Attibutes provide additional information about an element
#Attributes are always specified in the start tag
#Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

	The href Attribute 
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute.
You will learn more about links and the <a> tag later in this tutorial.

	The src Attribute
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute.

	The width and height Attributes 
Images in HTML have a set of size attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image.
The image size is specified in pixels: width="500" means 500 pixels wide.

	The alt Attribute
The alt attribute specified an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.
The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a blind person, can "hear" the element.
The alt attribute is also useful if the image does not exist;

	The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to specify the styling of an element, like color, font, size etc.
	
	The lang Attribute
The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.
The language is declared with the lang attribute.
Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines: <html lang="en-US">;
The first two latter specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, use two more letters (US).

	The title Attribute
Here, a title attribute is added to the <p> element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you moyse over the paragraph;

	We Suggest: Use Lowercase Attributes 
The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
The title attribute can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.
W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML. 
	AT W3SCHOOLS WE ALWAYS USE LOWERCASE ATTRIBUTE NAMES.

	USING QUOTES ARE THE MOST COMMON. OMITTING QUOTES CAN PRODUCE ERRORS.
	AT W3SCHOOLS WE ALWAYS USE QUOTES AROUND ATTRIBUTE VALUES.

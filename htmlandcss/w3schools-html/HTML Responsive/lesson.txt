	HTML Responsive Web Design
	What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, 
a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones);
NOTE: A web page should look good on any device!

	Setting The Viewport
When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element in all your web pages:
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

	Responsive Images
Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.
	Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down;
For example
 <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;"> 
Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better 
solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.
For example
 <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"> 

	Responsive Text Size
The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:
For example
 <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1> 
Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.

	Media Queries
In addition to resize text and images, it also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large 
screens and stacked vertically on small screens:

	HTML Links
Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow to click their way from page to page.
	
	HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
NOTE: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

	HTML Links - Syntax
In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag:
	<a href="url">Link text</a>
For example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link.
The link text is the visible part (visit our HTML tutorial).
Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.
NOTE: Without a forward slash at the end of subfplder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will
automaticlly add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.

	Local Link
The example above used an absolute URL (a full web address).
A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without http://www...).
For example
<a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a> 

	HTML Link Color
Be default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
	# An univisited link is underlined and blue
	# A visited link is underlined and purple
	# An active link  is underlined and red
You can change the default colors, by using CSS:
1) a:link;
2) a:visited;
3) a:hover;
4) a:active;

	HTML Links- The target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to open the link document.
The target can have one of the following values:
	# _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
	# _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
	# _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
	# _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
	# framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame
This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab;
TIP: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_top" to break out of the frame.

	HTML Links - Image as Link
It is common to use images as links;
For example:
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
</a> 
NOTE: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).

	HTML Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text
when the mouse moves over the element.

	HTML Links - Create a Bookmark
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.
Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.
To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, th page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute;
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page;
Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page;

	HTML File Paths
<img src="picture.jpg"> 	--- picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page
<img src="images/picture.jpg"> 	--- picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg">	--- picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg"> 	--- picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder

	HTML File Paths
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.
File paths are used when linking to external files like:
    # Web pages
    # Images
    # Style sheets
    # JavaScripts

	Absolute File Paths
An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file:
 <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> 

	Relative File Paths
A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.
In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:
	 <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> 

	Best Practice
It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. 
All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain 
and your future public domains.

	HTML Heading
Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
NOTE: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

	Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
User skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.
NOTE: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

	Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

	HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page

	The HTML <head> Element
The HTML <head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings.
The <head> element is a contaiber for metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag: <meta charset="UTF-8">

NOTE: Metadata typically define the document title, character  set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.

	HTML Elements
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).

	DO NOT FORGET THE END TAG
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
Never rely on this. It might produce unexpected result and/or erros if you forget the end tag.

	Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called elements.
<br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break).
Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.
HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readablt by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.

	Use Lowercase Tags
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

AT W3SCHOOLS WE ALWAYS USE LOWERCASE TAGS.

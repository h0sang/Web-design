	HTML Images
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

	HTML Images Syntax
In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag.
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image: 
	<img src="url">

	The alt Attribute
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it
(because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user a screen reader)
The value of the alt attribute should describe the image.
If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute;
NOTE: The alt attribute is required. A web page will not validate correctly without it.

	Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.
Alternatively, you can use the width and height attribute;
The width and height attribute always defines the width and height of the image in pixels.
NOTE: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might 
flicker while the image loads.

	Width and Height, or Style?
The width, height, and style attribute are valid in HTML5.
However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents style sheets from changing the size of images;

	Images in Another Folder
If not specified, the browser expects to find the image in the same folder as the web page.
However, it is common to store images in a sub-folder. You must then include the folder name in the src attribute;

	Images on another Server
Some web sites store their images on image servers.
Actually, you can access images from any web address in the world;

	Image Floating 
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text;

	Image Maps
The <map> tag defines an image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.
The name attribute of the <map> tag is associated with the <img>'s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.
The <map> element contains a number of <area> tags, that define the clickable areas in the image-map.
